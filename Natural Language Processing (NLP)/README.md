From this part of the course I learned some things about Natural Language Processing . NLP is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that helps computers understand human language. It is used to perform various tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and more.

In order for machine learning models to process text data, it is important to clean the text data first. This involves removing punctuation, special characters, and stop words.

Once the text is cleaned, the next step is to create a Bag of Words model. This model represents the text data in a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It counts the frequency of words in a document and creates a matrix that represents the words and their frequency in each document.

Finally, machine learning models can be applied to the Bag of Words model to perform various tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more. These models learn from the data and make predictions based on the patterns and relationships they discover.
