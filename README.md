# Machine-Learning

I have learned that machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The main objective of machine learning is to enable systems to learn from data and make accurate predictions or decisions based on that data.
In each folder above you will find the necessary code in order to build models and run the dataset you want . 

- Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous numerical values. It is commonly used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables.

- Classification is another type of supervised learning algorithm used to predict categorical or discrete values. It is used to classify new observations into predefined categories based on patterns observed in the training data.

- Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar observations into clusters. This type of algorithm is commonly used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image segmentation.

- Association rule learning is a technique used to find patterns or relationships between different variables in a dataset. It is commonly used for market basket analysis and recommendation systems.

- Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions based on rewards and punishments received from its environment. It is commonly used for game playing, robotics, and self-driving cars.

- Natural language processing is a field of machine learning concerned with the interaction between computers and human languages. It is commonly used for sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.

- Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data. It is commonly used for image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

- Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much relevant information as possible. It is commonly used for data visualization and feature selection.

- Model selection and boosting are techniques used to improve the accuracy and performance of machine learning models. Model selection involves selecting the best model from a set of candidate models, while boosting involves combining multiple weak models to form a strong model.
