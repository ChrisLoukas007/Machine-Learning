Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning used to train an AI to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. It is used in tasks such as game-playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a popular Reinforcement Learning model used to select the best option from a set of choices. UCB selects the option with the highest upper confidence bound, which is calculated based on the number of times the option has been chosen and the average reward received.

Thompson Sampling is another Reinforcement Learning model that is similar to UCB. However, instead of selecting the option with the highest upper confidence bound, Thompson Sampling selects an option based on probability distribution. The probability of an option being the best is updated based on the rewards received.

UCB and Thompson Sampling are used in various applications, such as advertising, clinical trials, and recommendation systems. UCB is preferred when the rewards are deterministic, while Thompson Sampling is preferred when the rewards are uncertain.
