From this section of my course I learned some things . 
Association rule learning is a technique used in data mining to discover associations between different items in a dataset. It helps in finding patterns or relationships between different items that are frequently bought or used together.

- Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm used for association rule learning. It is based on the concept of support, confidence, and lift, which helps in identifying the most relevant rules.The Apriori algorithm scans the database to identify the frequency of items and then uses the support measure to identify the most frequent itemsets. The algorithm then uses the confidence measure to generate association rules.

- The Eclat algorithm is another popular algorithm used for association rule learning. It is based on the concept of intersection and union of itemsets. It uses vertical data format and avoids the generation of candidate itemsets.

Both Apriori and Eclat algorithms are widely used in market basket analysis, which helps in identifying which products are frequently bought together. These algorithms are also used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and web mining.
