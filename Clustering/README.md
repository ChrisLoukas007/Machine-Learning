In Clustering you donâ€™t know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify some segments or clusters in your data. When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings you would have never thought of otherwise.

Clustering models:

- K-Means Clustering : Is a way to group similar items together based on their characteristics. It involves selecting a number of groups to form (called clusters) and assigning each item to a cluster so that the items within a cluster are as similar as possible to each other and as different as possible from the items in other clusters.

- Hierarchical Clustering : Is a way to group similar items together based on their characteristics, but it doesn't require selecting the number of groups (clusters) in advance. Instead, it starts by considering each item as a separate cluster, then groups similar clusters together until all the items belong to the same cluster. This forms a hierarchy of clusters, which can be visualized as a tree-like structure.
