Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks to learn from data and solve complex problems. It involves training a model with multiple layers of artificial neurons to identify patterns and features in large amounts of data.

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Regression: ANN models can be used for regression problems such as predicting a continuous variable. By training an ANN with multiple hidden layers, the model can identify complex relationships between the input variables and the target variable.

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Classification: ANN can also be used for classification problems, such as identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The output layer of the ANN will have multiple neurons, each representing a different class label, and the model will learn to assign the correct label to each input.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Computer Vision: CNN is a type of deep neural network that is particularly suited for computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. CNNs use a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to learn hierarchical representations of images and identify patterns and features.

Important Note about the ANN is this : If you do a ANN for Regression then you shouldn't choose activation function , but for Classification with only two categories like you want the prediction to be  0,1 or Y/N then you will need to choose a sigmoid activation function and if you do with more than two categories then you should use a softMax activation function
