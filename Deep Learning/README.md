Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks to learn from data and solve complex problems. It involves training a model with multiple layers of artificial neurons to identify patterns and features in large amounts of data.

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Regression: ANN models can be used for regression problems such as predicting a continuous variable. By training an ANN with multiple hidden layers, the model can identify complex relationships between the input variables and the target variable.

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Classification: ANN can also be used for classification problems, such as identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The output layer of the ANN will have multiple neurons, each representing a different class label, and the model will learn to assign the correct label to each input.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Computer Vision: CNN is a type of deep neural network that is particularly suited for computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. CNNs use a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to learn hierarchical representations of images and identify patterns and features.

Important Note about the ANN is this : If you do a ANN for Regression then you shouldn't choose activation function , but for Classification with only two categories like you want the prediction to be  0,1 or Y/N then you will need to choose a sigmoid activation function and if you do with more than two categories then you should use a softMax activation function 

So the difference between the ANN and Convolitional Neural Network is this : Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are two different types of deep learning models. ANNs are commonly used for tasks such as classification and regression, where the input data can be a vector or a matrix. They are made up of input, hidden, and output layers, with each layer consisting of multiple neurons that perform calculations on the input data.On the other hand, CNNs are mainly used for image and video recognition tasks. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data such as images. Unlike ANNs, they have multiple layers that perform a series of mathematical operations such as convolution and pooling to extract features from images. These features are then passed to fully connected layers that make predictions or classifications.

In summary, ANNs are more suited for general-purpose tasks such as regression and classification, while CNNs are designed specifically for computer vision tasks.
