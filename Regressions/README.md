As a student who has learned Machine Learning, I can tell you that regression is one of the most commonly used techniques to predict a continuous dependent variable. In simple words, it helps to find a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Before applying regression to a dataset, data preprocessing is an important step. It involves cleaning and transforming data so that it can be used for analysis.

- Simple Linear Regression is a regression technique that involves finding the linear relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. It is a basic and commonly used form of regression.

- Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression that involves finding the linear relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is used when more than one independent variable is expected to affect the dependent variable.

- Polynomial Regression is a regression technique that involves finding the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables raised to a power. It is useful when the relationship between the variables is not linear.

- Support Vector Regression is a regression technique that involves finding the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It uses a similar concept as Support Vector Machine classification and aims to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.

- Decision Tree Regression is a regression technique that involves creating a decision tree to predict the value of a dependent variable based on a set of independent variables. It is a popular method as it is easy to understand and interpret.

- Random Forest Regression is a regression technique that involves creating multiple decision trees and combining their predictions to make the final prediction. It is useful when dealing with large datasets and when there is a possibility of overfitting.

So in order to evaluate the Regression Models Performance we must check the accuracy of the models. Metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error are used for evaluation.

Here , I have uploaded code examples for each of these regression techniques, which can be easily applied to a dataset by changing the name of the dataset. These codes include steps for data preprocessing, creating and fitting the model, and evaluating the model's performance.
